																<p style="font-size: 18px;">School opens by 7am. The school gate opens by 7;30am and children are received by teachers at the gate till 8;00am. Classes start by 8;20am. Lateness can cause your child to miss out a valuable lesson.

                                It is normal for some children to have difficulty separating from parents or cry when dropping off. Please make your drop brief.
                                                                    
                                Parents are advised to please ensure that they do not double pack during pick and drop to avoid congestion and to ensure the school maintains a cordial relationship with our neighbours.
                                                                    
                                Normal Procedure is to release the child only to his/her parents or a child pick up permit card holder designated by parents. If someone other than the parent is to pick up the child, please notify us ahead of time. Without a child pickup card a child will not be released to unknown persons.
                                                                    
                                Drop off and pickup times are not good times to discuss child issues
                                                                    
                                                                    
                                <p> Late pickup fees</p>
                                                                    
                                <p style="font-size: 18px;">A late fee of N1000 per child for every 30 minutes after closing time will be charged. For children enrolled in the after school program a late fee of N2000 per child after 6pm will be charged. Payment will be made in cash in the time of pickup. Parents are expected to adhere to this policy.
                                                                    
                                On some bad days, parents are expected to call to say they are running late. Parents who do this will not be charged for the late pickup fee.</p>
                                                                    
                                                                    </p>

															<button type="button" class="collapsible">Communications</button>
															<div class="content">
																<p style="font-size: 18px;">Good communication is vital to the effective management of any establishment. It is important that we discuss any concerns or questions that may arise about any aspect of the child.
                                Each week, your child will come home with;
                                the home connection book= which serves as a means of communication between home and school. Also included in the communication book is a column which will explain some of the activities going on in the class, the current curriculum topics, events that will be happening that month, or any other pertinent information that may be interest.
                                Sensitive issues will be discussed in private outside of regular classroom hours. If you have a question regarding your child. please ask his/her teacher,. The teachers are the first resource for questions or difficulties. If the teacher is unable to resolve the issue. Please address your questions to the head of school.
                                It would be appreciated if parents make their appointment in advance in order to keep things running smoothly.
                                                                    
                                Also available at the school's admin office are the concern forms which can be filled if any concerns or complaints arise. These forms are sent directly to the director who would reply within 24 hours.
                                                                     
                                Please note that the school has zero tolerance for verbal or physical altercations between parents and teachers</p>
															</div>
															<button type="button" class="collapsible">Sick Policy</button>
															<div class="content">
																<p style="font-size: 18px;">Sick child policy; Under no circumstances should a parent bring a sick child to school, if the child shows any sign of illnessor is unable to participate in the normal and regular day program. Sick children expose other children as well as staff to the spread of their illness and require additional care and attention that we are unable to give. Moreover sick children want care from their parents in the comfort of their own homes. If other children become ill due to exposure to your sick child either because he/she wa sreturned to school before full recovery or he/she was not picked up promptly upon notice ofbecoming ill, other parents will become unnecessarily inconvinienced. Because this is disruptive to other children and their families, your cooperation on this issue is extremely important.

                                Every effort is taken to reduce the spread of illness by encouraging hand-washing and other sanitary practices.  If your child is unable to participate in normal activities of the day then your child must stay at home.
                                <p>SYMPTOMS REQUIRING REMOVAL OF CHILD FROM OUR CARE</p>
                                Fever: A child must be fever free for a minimum of 24 hours before returning to school that means the child is fever free without the aid of paracetamolor any other fever reducing substances.
                                Fever, sore throat, rash, vomiting, diarrhoea, earache, irritability or confusion.
                                <p>MEDICATION</p>
                                Parents will provide any medicatio neede by the child. Written authorization is needed for us to administer any medication. All medicines must have dosage instructions and times to be administered clearly written.

Minor injuries receive appropriate first aid from the school clinic and if emergency injury or illness occurs yur child will be taken to the nearest hospital where you will be asked to meet us.
